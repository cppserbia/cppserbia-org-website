# How to modernize your codebase?

## C++ Serbia Community Panel

In 2026, we are eagerly awaiting the release of a new C++ standard. This one is another feature-rich one, with major language-changing features like contracts and compile-time reflection, as well as quality-of-life improvements. All of these additions are there to help improve aspects of building things in C++ - security, performance, code reusability, etc.

However, there is a stark difference between the standard and what is out there in the field. While the committee discusses C++26, many of our production codebases still treat C++20 features as "novelties" or "too risky".

We have gathered a panel of industry veterans to answer the hard questions: How do you actually move a massive codebase forward? What are the blockers? How do you sell refactoring to management?

This isn't just a theoretical discussion. Our panellists represent the most demanding sectors of the industry, each bringing a unique perspective and constraints regarding code modernisation. We have people coming from automotive, embedded systems, open-source, enterprise software, gaming, HFT, and finance, all ready to discuss with the group on approaches for your specific use case.

## What We Will Cover

* **Strategies for incremental adoption of modern standards.**
* **Tooling and CI/CD improvements to automate modernisation.**
* **Overcoming cultural and technical resistance in your team.**
* **Live Q&A: Bring your specific blockers to the experts.**

The list of panellists will be announced soon!
