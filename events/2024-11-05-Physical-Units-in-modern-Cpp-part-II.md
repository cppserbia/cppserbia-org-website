# Physical Units in modern C++, part II

The typical embedded software project regularly deals with various measurements from the real world, such as temperature, pressure, acceleration, electrical current, etc. Ensuring that all these values are used properly and in a type-safe manner is no easy feat, and several features in modern C++ (i.e., from C++11 onward) can help us in this task.

Nikola will present both the original version of the library, which was developed in 2018 and presented in 2019 and the modern version, which was developed this year (2024), with some interesting improvements in linguistical and technical perspectives.
