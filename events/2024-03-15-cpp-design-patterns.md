# Modern C++ Design Patterns

This session will explore how traditional design patterns can be implemented in modern C++, taking advantage of language features introduced in C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20.

## Agenda

### Introduction

- Brief history of design patterns
- Why patterns matter in C++
- How modern C++ changes pattern implementation

### Creational Patterns

- Factory Method with function objects and lambdas
- Abstract Factory with concepts
- Builder with fluent interfaces
- Singleton alternatives in modern C++

### Structural Patterns

- Adapter with variadic templates
- Bridge with type erasure
- Composite with std::variant
- Decorator with function composition

### Behavioral Patterns

- Observer with signals and slots
- Strategy with std::function
- Command with lambdas and std::bind
- Visitor with std::visit and variants

### Modern C++ Specific Patterns

- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- PIMPL (Pointer to Implementation)
- Type erasure
- Expression templates

## Case Study

We'll work through a complete case study that demonstrates how to refactor a traditional OOP design pattern implementation to a more idiomatic modern C++ approach, highlighting the benefits in terms of performance, safety, and expressiveness.
