# The hidden performance price of C++ virtual functions

Virtual function mechanism is one of the core concepts of C++, however, it does come with a performance price.
But how high is that price? In this talk we are going to dissect virtual functions to understand when they are slow and why they are slow.
We will investigate how well virtual functions use the CPU's underlying resources and how good is the compiler at optimizing virtual functions.
We will also present several techniques to help you speed up your program using virtual functions.
