# What's going on with Contracts?

This talk will cover what the contracts are, what was accepted (and kept after meetings despite some concerns) in the C++26 standard, what the concerns were, what they were missing, and whether Contracts, as proposed, are actually useful, harmful, or dead on arrival, as some claim.
