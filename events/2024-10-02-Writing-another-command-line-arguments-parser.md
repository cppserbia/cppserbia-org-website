# Writing another command line arguments parser

There are already dozens of libraries for parsing command-line arguments, with different design philosophies, features, and usage ergonomics. So, let's write another one. This will be an exercise in designing and implementing a basic command-line argument parser. The goal is to review the design decisions and implementation details (including choice of tooling) and discuss and criticise them. The focus will be on the mistakes made as the code is written and rewritten and still not quite finished (it is never fully finished).

But, importantly, we will try to answer the main question: why would you even write a command-line argument parser?
