# Baby, don't test me, no more

In this lecture, Aleksandar will talk about some misconceptions related to unit testing in general, which he encountered during his career as a C++ developer. He will also talk about the overall mindset and how to solve concrete problems, and what tradeoffs have to sometimes be made in order to battle untestable code.

Although this is a beginner-to-intermediate-level lecture, the problems he will mention are often caused by the mindset of engineers from different backgrounds and with varying levels of experience.
