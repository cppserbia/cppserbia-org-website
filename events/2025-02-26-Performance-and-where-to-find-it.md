# Performance and where to find it

Building performant software is an important aspect when working on any programming project. This holds much more value when working on C++ projects, which are usually the most critical performing piece in the software stacks.

Dušan will talk about where we should look for the performance in our projects, starting from the design but also covering micro-optimizations to get the most out of our hardware.
