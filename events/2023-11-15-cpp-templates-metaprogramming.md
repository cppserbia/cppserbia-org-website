# C++ Templates and Metaprogramming

This online workshop will explore the powerful world of C++ templates and metaprogramming. We'll cover both fundamental concepts and advanced techniques that allow you to write more generic, efficient, and expressive code.

## Workshop Outline

### Template Fundamentals

- Function and class templates
- Template specialization
- Variadic templates
- Template parameter deduction

### Advanced Template Techniques

- SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)
- Tag dispatching
- Type traits
- C++20 concepts

### Metaprogramming

- Compile-time computation
- Type manipulation
- Policy-based design
- Expression templates

### Practical Applications

- Building a type-safe container
- Implementing a compile-time state machine
- Creating a DSL (Domain Specific Language)

## Interactive Format

This workshop will include live coding demonstrations and interactive exercises. Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions and get feedback on their code.

## Prerequisites

- Solid understanding of C++ basics
- Familiarity with templates and generic programming
- C++17 or C++20 compiler installed

## About the Instructor

Marija Petrović is a C++ consultant specializing in template metaprogramming and library design. She has contributed to several open-source C++ libraries and regularly speaks at C++ conferences.

## Registration

Registration is required. A Zoom link will be sent to registered participants 1 hour before the event.
