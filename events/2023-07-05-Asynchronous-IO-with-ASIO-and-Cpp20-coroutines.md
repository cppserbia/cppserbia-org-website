# Asynchronous IO with ASIO and C++20 coroutines

Input/Output operations, such as writing to a disk or reading from a socket, are significantly slower than accessing the CPU. Asynchronous IO is a form of input/output processing that allows the application to perform other processing while IO operations are being performed.

Using asynchronous (event-driven) architecture allows the development of efficient and scalable software. However, as the number (and composition) of asynchronous operations grow, the callback-based approach can increase complexity and decrease readability. C++20 introduced stackless coroutines to improve code clarity while the benefits of an asynchronous implementation are preserved.

ASIO library provides asynchronous IO and execution functions. It has first-class support for C++20 coroutines. A combination of ASIO and coroutines significantly improved and simplified Asynchronous IO programming in C++.

In this talk, we will cover:

* ASIO's asynchronous model and basics
* C++20 improvements

Applying ASIO and coroutines on a tiny IO application
