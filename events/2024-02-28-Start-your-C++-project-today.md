# Start your C++ project today

Join us on Wednesday with [Dušan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duxi90/), who will provide a cheat sheet and a checklist to guide you when embarking on a fresh C++ project. Whether you’re considering open-sourcing your library, building a utility tool, video game, or desktop application, or even setting up your company’s codebase with C++ at its core, come exchange your ideas and experiences with the Serbia C++ community!

On this meetup, we’ll discuss the complexities of setting up a new C++ project. We’ll cover the essential aspects, from choosing the right tools to setting up your environment, and reduce the barrier of entry for anyone eager to start their own C++ project.

We’ll explore topics like build systems, toolchains, packaging, dependency management, third-party libraries and setting up your developer environment. Additionally, we’ll discuss the must-haves of any modern project, and suggest tools that can significantly improve code quality - even for those who are working on existing projects.

The goal is to clear the path for you, enabling you to sit back, relax, and transform your innovative ideas into modern C++ code.
