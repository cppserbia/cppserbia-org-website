# C++ and the Art of Self-Modifying Code (Don't Try This at Home!)

Instructions, operations, variables, code, data, pictures, videos, word documents, and programs are all distinctions that are mostly useful for us humans to work with things. But when you think about it, all these things exist together in memory. And if it exists in memory, it has an address. And if it has an address, you can point to it. And if you can point to it, you can probably change it. So, if we leave behind the notion that there is data and there are programs that change data and accept that it's all just bytes, we realize that we can write programs that change programs or events themselves. This is generally frowned upon for good reasons and should not be done in any serious setting.
However, it is fun, a good exercise, and possibly an interesting meetup talk.
