# Practical Multithreading in C++

Join us for a hands-on workshop on multithreading in C++. This session will focus on practical aspects of concurrent programming, with plenty of code examples and exercises.

## Workshop Content

### Thread Basics

- Creating and managing threads
- Thread lifecycle
- Thread parameters and return values
- Thread pools

### Synchronization Mechanisms

- Mutexes and locks
- Condition variables
- Atomic operations
- Lock-free programming

### Parallel Patterns

- Producer-consumer
- Thread-safe data structures
- Work stealing
- Task-based parallelism

### Performance Considerations

- False sharing and cache coherency
- Memory ordering
- Scalability challenges
- Measuring and profiling

## Hands-on Exercises

Throughout the workshop, participants will work on several exercises:

1. Implementing a thread-safe queue
2. Building a parallel image processing application
3. Creating a simple task scheduler
4. Optimizing a concurrent algorithm for performance

## Requirements

- Laptop with a C++17 compatible compiler
- Basic understanding of C++ and object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with standard library containers

## About the Instructor

Stefan Nikolić is a senior software engineer specializing in high-performance computing. He has extensive experience developing multithreaded applications for scientific computing and data processing.

## Materials

Code samples and exercises will be provided at the beginning of the workshop. Solutions will be discussed during the session and made available afterward.
