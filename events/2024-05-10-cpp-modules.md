# C++20 Modules in Practice

Join us for a practical session on C++20 modules, one of the most significant changes to the C++ language in decades. This workshop will focus on real-world adoption of modules in existing codebases.

## Workshop Topics

### Introduction to Modules

- The problems with the preprocessor and header files
- Module basics: export, import, and module
- Module partitions and implementation units
- Module interfaces vs. module implementation

### Migration Strategies

- Incremental adoption approaches
- Header units as a transition mechanism
- Dealing with legacy code
- Compatibility considerations

### Build Systems Integration

- Modules in CMake
- Modules in Visual Studio
- Modules in other build systems
- Performance implications for build times

### Best Practices and Patterns

- Module organization strategies
- Interface design considerations
- Versioning and compatibility
- Testing modularized code

## Hands-on Exercise

Participants will work on modularizing a small codebase, learning how to:

1. Identify module boundaries
2. Convert headers to module interfaces
3. Handle dependencies between modules
4. Set up a build system for modules

## Prerequisites

- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 11+, Clang 16+, or MSVC 19.28+)
- Basic familiarity with C++ and build systems
- Laptop with development environment set up

## About the Presenter

Miloš Đorđević is a C++ developer and build system expert. He has been working with C++20 modules since their early implementations and has helped several teams adopt modules in production codebases.

## Materials

Example code and exercises will be provided at the beginning of the workshop. Solutions and additional resources will be shared afterward.
