# Simplifying Raft with C++20 coroutines

This presentation explores the Raft consensus algorithm, essential in distributed systems.

It starts with an overview of Raft. Following this, the talk focuses on developing a network library tailored for Raft's needs, highlighting how C++20 coroutines simplify asynchronous programming.

The final part showcases a Raft Server implementation, demonstrating the effective integration of the network library with C++20 features. Aimed at providing practical and theoretical knowledge, this session is suitable for those interested in modern C++ development and distributed systems.
