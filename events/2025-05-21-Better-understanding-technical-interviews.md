# Better understanding technical interviews

Did you ever go to a technical interview where you had to do live coding sessions with all the algorithms that you have (or have not) learned in an Algorithms course, just so that you never use them on the job?

If yes, this lecture/presentation is for you! We will explore the current state of interviews, how the employer can tweak them to get a better match for the position they are hiring, and what information the candidate can get out of that whole process so that they can assess whether that position is for them.
