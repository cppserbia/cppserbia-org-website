# Advanced C++ Memory Management

Join us for an in-depth exploration of memory management techniques in C++. This session will cover advanced topics that can help you optimize your applications and avoid common memory-related pitfalls.

## Topics Covered

### Understanding the Memory Model

- Stack vs. heap allocation
- Memory layout of C++ objects
- Alignment requirements and padding

### Custom Allocators

- When and why to use custom allocators
- Implementing a simple pool allocator
- Stateful allocators and the allocator interface

### Memory Optimization Techniques

- Object pools and arenas
- Small object optimization
- Memory-mapped files

### Debugging Memory Issues

- Tools for detecting memory leaks
- Analyzing memory usage patterns
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate C++ knowledge
- Understanding of basic memory concepts (new/delete, RAII)

## About the Speaker

Nikola Jovanović is a systems programmer with extensive experience in performance-critical applications. He has worked on trading systems where memory management is crucial for low-latency operations.

## Materials
