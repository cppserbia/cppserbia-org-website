# A C++ Tooling Journey: From Manual Dependencies to Cross-Compilation

This talk shares a use case of C++ dependency management and build environment challenges in a resource-constrained small development team. Through real-world examples, we'll go over the journey from manual dependency handling to modern cross-compilation workflows, covering some tools, techniques, and lessons along the way.
