# C++ Concurrency and Parallelism

Join us for an in-depth exploration of concurrency and parallelism in C++. This session will cover both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of concurrent programming in C++.

## Agenda

### Part 1: Foundations of Concurrency

- Understanding threads and processes
- Race conditions and data races
- Synchronization primitives
- Memory models and atomics

### Part 2: C++ Concurrency Library

- `std::thread` and thread management
- Mutexes and locks
- Condition variables
- Futures and promises
- `std::async` and task-based programming

### Part 3: Parallel Algorithms

- Introduction to the parallel algorithms library
- Execution policies
- Performance considerations
- Real-world examples

## Hands-on Workshop

During the second half of the session, we'll work through practical examples together. You'll learn how to:

- Implement a thread-safe data structure
- Use parallel algorithms to speed up data processing
- Debug common concurrency issues
- Profile and optimize concurrent code

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate C++ knowledge
- Familiarity with basic C++ syntax and standard library
- Laptop with a C++17 compatible compiler for the hands-on portion

## About the Speaker

Nikola Petrović is a systems programmer specializing in high-performance computing. He has extensive experience developing concurrent applications for financial and scientific computing domains.

Refreshments will be provided. We look forward to seeing you there!
