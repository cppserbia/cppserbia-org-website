# The New Year's C++ Quiz

🎄🇷🇸 C++ Serbia `&&` C++ Prague 🇨🇿🎄

We are wrapping up the year with a special collaboration with friends and colleagues from C++ Prague. Instead of the usual talk, we’re handing the compilation control over to you.

Join us simultaneously from Belgrade or Prague for our Grand End-of-Year C++ Quiz. Whether you are a template metaprogramming wizard or just starting out, come hang out, represent your local community, and celebrate the end of a great year of coding.

What’s on the menu:

* **The Quiz**: Tricky, fun, and educational C++ questions.
* **The Prizes**: We have some awesome loot for the winners.
* **The Vibe**: Good company, drinks, and holiday cheer.

We will be gathering at 18h, with the quiz starting at 18:30!
