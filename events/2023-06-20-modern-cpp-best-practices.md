# Modern C++ Best Practices

This online workshop will cover modern C++ best practices that every C++ developer should know. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll learn valuable techniques to write safer, more maintainable code.

## Topics Covered

### Memory Management

- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- Smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, `std::weak_ptr`)
- Avoiding memory leaks and dangling pointers

### Effective STL Usage

- Choosing the right containers
- Algorithms and function objects
- Using range-based for loops effectively

### Error Handling

- Exceptions vs. error codes
- When and how to use exceptions
- The Rule of Zero/Five

### Performance Considerations

- Move semantics
- Perfect forwarding
- Avoiding unnecessary copies

## Workshop Format

This will be an interactive workshop with live coding examples. Participants are encouraged to ask questions throughout the session.

## Requirements

- Zoom client installed on your computer
- A C++17 compatible compiler if you want to try the examples yourself

## About the Instructor

Ana Jovanović is a C++ consultant specializing in code optimization and modern C++ techniques. She has helped numerous companies modernize their codebases and adopt best practices.

Registration is required. A Zoom link will be sent to registered participants 1 hour before the event.
