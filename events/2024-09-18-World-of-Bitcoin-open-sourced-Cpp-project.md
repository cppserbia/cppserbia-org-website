# World of Bitcoin - open-sourced C++ project

In a world of electronic payments and fast money transfers, rarely a few would understand the role of software as the medium of exchange.

Since 2009 and the emergence of Bitcoin, the world has entered a new era where units of exchange (money) are actually open-source software written in C++. With the strong usage of cryptography and its distributed nature, Bitcoin is gradually becoming the new fundament of the worldwide coin exchange system.

In this talk, we will walk through the basics of economy and software development with a strong focus on the technical aspects of the Bitcoin project itself. We will showcase the code samples, dive through essential cryptography fundaments and explore the world of distributed blockchain systems. We will bring closer the use of C++, build systems, testing strategies, wallet creation, and concepts such as UTXO and internal scripting mechanisms inside Bitcoin.
