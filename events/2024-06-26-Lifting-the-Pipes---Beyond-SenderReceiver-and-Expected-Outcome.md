# Lifting the Pipes - Beyond Sender/Receiver and Expected Outcome

In June, we will have Mirko Arsenijević, a Staff Engineer at Inceptive. In this talk, we will introduce a library for creating execution graphs (structured representations of the flow and execution order of operations) that are both easily readable and writable. We'll explore the library's core concepts and features, showcasing how it simplifies the development of complex execution flows.

Additionally, we will compare the library with the Sender/Receiver proposal, specifically focusing on the aspect of graph creation (excluding executors and async invocation from the discussion), highlighting the differences in approach between the two models.
Furthermore, we will compare this library to Expected Outcome pipelines, a programming paradigm where composition chains are created using std::expected. We'll discuss the limitations of each approach, providing some examples to illustrate their applications.
