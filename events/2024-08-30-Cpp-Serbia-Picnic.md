# C++ Serbia Picnic

Hi all,

Due to the ongoing heat waves, vacation season, and general summer mood, we received feedback from the community that it is challenging to focus on lectures and deep dives into C++ features, developments, and use cases. It seems the perfect time to go outside, touch grass, and connect with nature. This created an initiative to organize another event aimed toward casual C++ conversations, but this time in Košutnjak.

We are preparing a picnic for all community members. Everyone is free to join in, meet people, discuss the release of C++26, have a bite, and cool down with some cold liquid refreshments.

For this event, we invite everyone to respond, either here or on any of our social hubs, so that we stock up enough for everyone to have a good time!
