# Atomic operations and lock-free data structures in C++

In this talk, [Đorđe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/djordje-nedic) will offer a fresh perspective on atomic operations and lock-free data structures, comparing their applications in standard software development with embedded/systems programming as well as showcasing less common approaches.

The talk should offer something for everyone, from students to experienced developers, as it goes from basics of atomic operations all the way to intricacies of lock-free data structure design choices and hardware/software interaction.
