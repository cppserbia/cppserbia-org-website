# Meeting C++ 2023 — Trip report

Meeting C++ 2023 is one of the largest C++ conferences, and probably the largest one in Europe. First edition was held in Düsseldorf in 2012. Since 2014, the conference is hosted in Berlin.

Why trip report from Meeting C++?

In 2016, the conference organizer presented a map of User Groups in Europe. What caught my attention is that no C++ User Groups exist in Serbia or the Balkans. That's when the idea for bootstrapping Serbian C++ UG was born.

I'll cover some of the conference talks I attended, and we can also share the experiences from the other C++ conferences.

Although we'll briefly bring up some of the advanced C++ topics, this won't be a classic tech talk. We'll highlight why on-site meetups and conferences still have value in spite of emerging remote learning/working, etc.
