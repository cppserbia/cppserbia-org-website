# C++ and Rust — When to choose which?

Hi, my name is [Nebojša](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsabovic/) and I worked in C++ my whole professional life.

I started in middle school (Borland C++/TurboVision), then at Palm on PalmOS/C++ on Palm Treo, WebKit, then at Google on Chrome, V8 and NaCl (gcc-based security toolchain), then on Apache Traffic Server and NodeJs at Linkedin.

I have founded a company to make autofocusing glasses for presbyopia, a condition that eventually happens to all of us, and in this talk I will explain why we chose Rust as the implementation language. I will also explain how we interface with C++ code and talk about Rust ecosystem and what we learned that is also applicable to C++ projects.
