# End of the year — Lightning celebration

As tradition dictates, we are celebrating the end of 2024. with lightning talks. The floor is open for everyone to share their C++ stories in a short format. Come and share the experiences from your C++ journey with the rest of the C++ Serbia community over some warm(ing) drinks!
