# C++ Serbia does code review

Hello, C++ Serbia community! For April's meetup, we have prepared something different. Instead of our usual lectures, we will have collaborative code review sessions on Wednesday.

Participate by bringing your code snippets or projects and letting the community review them or show up ready to give constructive feedback.
We will have dedicated code reviewers to start the discussion, but everyone is invited to comment and ask the author and other reviewers questions.

You can send your snippets beforehand by messaging the organisers directly through any of the C++ Serbia channels.

Link za Slack workspace C++ user grupe i Google/iCal kalendar možete naći [ovde](https://cppserbia.com).
