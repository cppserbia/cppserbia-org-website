# C++ Serbia does code review

Hello, C++ Serbia community! Due to popular demand, we're organising another code review session.

Participate by bringing your code snippets or projects and letting the community review them or show up ready to give constructive feedback.
We will have dedicated code reviewers to start the discussion, but everyone is invited to comment and ask the author and other reviewers questions.

You can send your snippets beforehand by messaging the organisers directly through any of the C++ Serbia channels.

**Zoom link**: [https://cppserbia.com/meet](https://cppserbia.com/meet)

Date and time: **29th of January (Wednesday), 6pm**
Location: **Beograđanka, Vidikovac, 22nd floor**
Address: **Masarikova 5**
