# Introduction to borrow checking in C++

In the last few years, a lot of people from C++ community are trying to implement something similar to Rust's Borrow Checker.

This is a hard problem and because Borrow Checker is meant to check for violations at compile-time, the solution would require changes in the compiler in order to have full-fledged functionality.

Nevertheless, there are ideas how this can be achieved, at least at runtime. Although this is far from [Rust's borrowing mechanism](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html), there are some interesting opportunities revolving around those implementations.

In this talk, we'll introduce basic terminology and present couple of ideas how (partial) borrow checking can be implemented.
